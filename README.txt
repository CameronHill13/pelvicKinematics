Code and data has been provided as supplementary data for the following publication in The Royal Society:

"The impact of pelvic lateral rotation on hindlimb kinematics and stride length in the red-legged running frog, Kassina maculata"

by Dr Amber J. Collings, Dr Lauara B. Porro, Dr Cameron Hill & Dr Christopher T. Richards.

The code has been depositied to GitHub (DOI: XXXXXXX) "http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
The raw data and experimental data has been uploaded to the Figshare portal that is provided with this publication.

The code requires access to Wolfram Mathematica for kinematic analyses and plots, whilst R is required for linear mixed-effects models.
Specific instructions has been provided on the order in which code and analyses should be run.
