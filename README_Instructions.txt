The code should be run in the following order:

1. Code to Archive Data.nb

All code hereafter requires the METADATA.xlsx spreadsheet

2. Stick Figure and Speed Analysis.nb
3. Stick Figure and 3D Jint Angles.nb
4. Stick Figure and Pelvic Vector Analysis.nb
5. Hindlimb Joint Angle Plots.nb
6. Staistical Analysis.nb
7. Segment Angles - Polar Coordinates
8. Finding position of maximum hip extension - Single limb cycle.nb
9. Pelvic Vector Analyses Plots.nb
10. Hindlimb Joint Angles Plots

For the linear mixed-effect models, Rcodefrogkinstats.txt needs to be imported into R and run.
Save the R output.
Collect "(Intercept)" and "Angle..y." or "PAngle" value from the R output for each analyses.

Run the following code, inputting the above data into the relevant places within the code:

11. Speed Gain and LME Analysis Plots.nb

Finally, run the following code to dtermine footfall patterns during frog walking (required Footfall Pattern Data.xlxs"

12. Footfall Patterns.nb
